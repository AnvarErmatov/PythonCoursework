## Write a program that asks the user to enter a person�s age. The program should display a message 
## indicating whether the person is an infant, a child, a teenager, or an adult. Following are the guidelines:
## If the person is 1 year old or less, he or she is an infant.
## If the person is older than 1 year, but younger than 13 years, he or she is a child.
## If the person is at least 13 years old, but less than 20 years old, he or she is a teenager.
## If the person is at least 20 years old, he or she is an adult

age = float(input("Enter your age here: "))
if age <= 1:
    print("Infant")
elif age >= 1 and age < 13: 
    print("Child")
elif age >= 13 and age < 20: 
    print("Teenager")
elif age >= 20: 
    print("Adult")
